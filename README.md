A demonstration dataset for A431 derived CD63-GFP tagged EVs is available at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.10125647.
Copy SPFI.mat and the libraries folder into the main working directory (containing subfolders 1 & 2 with nd2 files for the two timepoints).

Reading of nd2 files is not supported by base Matlab and requires the Open Microscopy Environment (https://www.openmicroscopy.org/) bfmatlab (https://www.openmicroscopy.org/bio-formats/downloads/) or other repositories.
